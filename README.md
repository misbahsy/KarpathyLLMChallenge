# SolvingKarpathyChallenge
This is an attempt at solving the LLM Challenge put out by Andrej Karpathy on X [(twitter)](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1760740503614836917?s=20)

>Fun LLM challenge that I'm thinking about: take my 2h13m tokenizer video and translate the video into the format of a book chapter (or a blog post) on tokenization. Something like:
>
>1. Whisper the video
>2. Chop up into segments of aligned images and text
>3. Prompt engineer an LLM to translate piece by piece
>4. Export as a page, with links citing parts of original video
>
>More generally, a workflow like this could be applied to any input video and auto-generate "companion guides" for various tutorials in a more readable, skimmable, searchable format. Feels >tractable but non-trivial.



The articles generated in this repo as markdowns (other than readme) are using LLMs. Happy to take any [feedback](https://twitter.com/MisbahSy).
